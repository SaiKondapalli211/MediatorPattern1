**What is the Mediator Design Pattern?**

The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling between objects by centralizing their communication in a mediator instead of allowing them to communicate directly. This helps reduce dependencies and makes the system more maintainable.

**What is CQRS pattern?**

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a design pattern that separates read (query) and write (command) operations in a system. Instead of using the same model for reading and writing data, 

CQRS divides responsibilities to improve performance, scalability, and maintainability.

🔹 Why Use CQRS?

✔ Improves performance – Read and write operations can be optimized independently.


✔ Scalability – Reads and writes can be scaled separately.

✔ Better maintainability – Code is cleaner and easier to modify.

✔ Security – Commands can be restricted to specific roles.

✔ Event Sourcing – Works well with event-driven architectures.

**🔹 CQRS Architecture in .NET Core**

In CQRS, we separate:

Commands: Modify data (e.g., CreateOrderCommand).

Queries: Fetch data (e.g., GetOrderQuery).

🔹 Key Components in .NET Core CQRS Implementation:

1️⃣ Commands – Handle write operations.

2️⃣ Command Handlers – Process commands (create, update, delete).

3️⃣ Queries – Handle read operations.

4️⃣ Query Handlers – Process queries (retrieve data).

5️⃣ MediatR – Facilitates communication between commands/queries and handlers.

6️⃣ Entity Framework (EF Core) or Dapper – Used for database access.


**1. Can you briefly explain your health insurance application and its architecture?**

My health insurance application follows a microservices-like modular approach, where different services handle various responsibilities:

Policy Service: Manages policy creation.

Claim Service: Handles customer claims.

Premium Service: Calculates premium based on customer data.

Notification Service: Sends notifications to customers.

To ensure loose coupling, I implemented the Mediator Design Pattern using dependency injection (DI) in ASP.NET Core. Instead of services communicating directly, a mediator handles interactions, making the system more maintainable and scalable.

**2. What is the Mediator Design Pattern, and why did you choose it for this project?**

The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that centralizes communication between objects, reducing direct dependencies.

I chose it because:

It decouples services, making them independent and easier to maintain.

It simplifies communication between multiple services.

It improves scalability, as adding new services requires minimal changes.

It enhances testability, allowing services to be tested in isolation.

For example, when a policy is created, instead of PolicyService calling PremiumService and NotificationService directly, it notifies the mediator, which then triggers the appropriate services.

**3. How did you implement the Mediator Pattern in ASP.NET Core?**

Created an IInsuranceMediator interface to act as a central communication hub.

Implemented InsuranceMediator, which coordinates interactions between services.

Refactored services (PolicyService, ClaimService, etc.) to communicate via the mediator instead of calling each other directly.

Used ASP.NET Core DI to register services and inject dependencies at runtime.

This approach ensures loosely coupled architecture, making it easier to modify and scale.

**4. How does Dependency Injection (DI) work in your implementation?**
Answer:

I registered all services and the IInsuranceMediator in Program.cs.

The Mediator (InsuranceMediator) uses IServiceProvider to resolve dependencies dynamically.

Services like PolicyService and ClaimService receive the mediator through constructor injection.

This allows services to be injected at runtime, ensuring better dependency management.

Example:

builder.Services.AddSingleton<IInsuranceMediator, InsuranceMediator>();

builder.Services.AddTransient<PolicyService>();

builder.Services.AddTransient<ClaimService>();

builder.Services.AddTransient<PremiumService>();

builder.Services.AddTransient<NotificationService>();

This way, ASP.NET Core manages lifetime and scope for each service.

**5. How does the Mediator pattern improve scalability in your application?**
Answer:

Adding new services is easy: If I need a new service (e.g., Fraud Detection Service), I just update the mediator instead of modifying all existing services.

Reduces tight coupling: Services don’t depend on each other, making changes easier.

Enhances maintainability: If one service changes, others remain unaffected.

Supports multiple event-driven actions: A single event (e.g., “PolicyCreated”) can trigger multiple services.

**6. What are the potential drawbacks of using the Mediator pattern? How did you handle them?**
Answer:

Single Point of Failure: If the mediator fails, communication between services stops.

Solution: Used dependency injection so the mediator is managed by ASP.NET Core’s DI container.

Increased Complexity: Having a centralized mediator means more code for handling interactions.

Solution: Kept the mediator logic clean and limited responsibilities by breaking it into smaller methods.

Performance Overhead: Mediator introduces an extra layer of method calls.

Solution: Used scoped services and ensured efficient dependency resolution.

**7. Can you explain a real-time scenario where the Mediator pattern is used in your project?**
Answer:

Sure! Suppose a customer purchases a new health insurance policy.

The PolicyService creates the policy and notifies the mediator.

The mediator then:

Calls PremiumService to calculate the insurance premium.

Calls NotificationService to send a confirmation email to the customer.

This way, PolicyService doesn’t directly call other services, ensuring loose coupling.

**8. How would you integrate MediatR in your project instead of a custom mediator?**

Instead of manually implementing a mediator, I could use MediatR, a popular library for the Mediator Pattern in .NET.

Steps:

Install MediatR:

dotnet add package MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
